        YourCalc respects your privacy. All calculations happen locally in your
        browser.

      <h2>Microphone Usage</h2>
      <p>
        The microphone is used only when you manually enable it. When turned
        off, the app stops listening immediately.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some browsers (such as Chrome) may briefly display a microphone indicator
        after the mic is stopped. This behavior is controlled by the browser.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p>
        YourCalc does not store, transmit, or share your voice data or
        calculations.

      <p>
        This application runs entirely on your device.
